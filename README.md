# Simulation and Sampling

Project carried out as a student at the University of Edinburgh.

Report: 
* Confidence interval approximation assessment: comparison of the coverage of two confidence interval constructions for the expectation parameter $\lambda$
 in a model for observations $y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$.
* Estimation of parameters for a Bayesian statistical model of material use in a 3D printer.
